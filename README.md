# This repository contains codes examples for the parameter estimation and model validation of kinetic models that combine isotermal and adiabatic data.
the Tree structured parzen estimator and the CMA-ES algorithm are implemented for parameter estimation.
A stratifed cross validation is used as model validation method.
